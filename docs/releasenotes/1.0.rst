RB Gateway 1.0 Release Notes
============================

**Release date**: July 4, 2018


Introducing RB Gateway
======================

RB Gateway, the Review Board Gateway microservice, was built to help manage
and host Git and Mercurial repositories within your network in a way that
allows services like `Review Board`_ to better integrate with them, access
their contents remotely, and to be notified when changes occur within the
repository.

RB Gateway can be installed on Linux, macOS, or Windows. See the
:ref:`installation instructions <rb-gateway-installation>` to get started.
